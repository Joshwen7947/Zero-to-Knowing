Let's begin with a simple one, we will use the Animal class from the last lesson
Create a child class called fish
Create a method called swim, if the sound is equal to None, print I am a fish, I don't have a sound
Otherwise print, Are you sure you're a fish
Create a 2nd method called ocean, ask the fish which ocean they live in and print off

Create an obejct and call all 4 methods

We need a superclass for Vehicles
Our constructor needs a cars info: make, model, year and price
Create a method to check if the make is ford, chevy or tesla, if so return American Made
Otherwise return Imported
Create a method that returns the Vehicles model
Create a method that checks if the car year is newer than 2000, is so return Car from the 21st century
Otherwise return This car is old!
Create a method that accepts a max_price you're willing to pay, this method checks if the car price is under your budget.  It yes, return Within your budget Otherwise return Over your budget

Create a child class called Style
This class accepts a superclass, and also has a parameter of num_of_doors
Create a method, if num_of_doors is 4 return Family car, Otherwise return Sports Car

Create 3 objects.  1 uses the superclass, 2 use the child class

Creating a class for our agents, james bond and ethan hunt
NOTE -> Try completing this without using the slides!
Create a superclass that takes name, health and car
Create a superclass method that prints the Agents info

Create a child class called Spy, this inherits everything from the parent classAdd 3 additional properties of Agency, location and killed (killed is set to False)

(Ethan hunt will be the bad guy)
Create a method to attack/assassinate the other agent, this takes an object as a parameter
If the enemys health is greater than 0, subtract 20 from their health.  Show who has lost 20 health and show their updated health level
If the enemy is less than 0, then killed becomes True, print off [enemy name] is dead

Create 2 instances of the Spy class, one for James Bond the other for Ethan hunt
Call the method to show the Agents info, then wait 5 seconds
While ethan hunt health is greater than 0, both objects call assassinate
After every attack the program waits 2 seconds before the next
