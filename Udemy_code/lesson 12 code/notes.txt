The user can enter 1 - begin or 2 - stop
Once the timer is complete, print off the time passed rounded down

You need to create a countdown clock
For this consider using a loop with a counter variable
Every second, print off the current second
Print "Your countdown finished after: ____ seconds" once it completes

We want to create a program to calculate the time it takes to download a file
We ask the user 2 questions. Flize size in Megabytes and internet speed in megabits/second
Convert the file to megabits (1 Megabyte = 8 megabits), then calculates the download time
Display the number of seconds the download will take
Use the countdown timer to display the download process taking place
End with printing "Download complete"
