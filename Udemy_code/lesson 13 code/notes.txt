Create two functions, one function draws a square, the other draws a triangle
Each function taks two parameters, an object and a size
Create your object, then call both functions
The drawing needs to stay on the screen when done

Create an input asking which shape you want to draw
If user enters square, call the square function
If user enters triangle, call triangle function
Otherwise, print "We can't do that yet!"
