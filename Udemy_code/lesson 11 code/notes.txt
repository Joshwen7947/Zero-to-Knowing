Create a program that assigns passengers to two different flights
Ask the user if they want a new flight, if their answer is not "no" the program continues
Create a variable for a random flight number
If that random flight is equal to 1, increase the counter by 1
If the random flight is equal to 2, increase another counter by 1
At the end of the loop, show the number of passenegers on each flight

Create a guessing game. Two variables, one with a random numberm, the other with an input
If input is too low, print off Too low
If the input is too high, print Too High
Otherwise, print Congrats!

Refactor your last guessing game to improve input
We want to add the ability to continue guessing until we get the right number
Think loops!
Once the random number is guessed, print Congrats and the number of times it took
