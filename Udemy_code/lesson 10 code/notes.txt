We need a program to determine the salary for full-time and hourly employees
There will be 2 functions in a seperate file
the hourly function will accept hours worked. with a rate of 25 per hourly
Multiply their hours worked with rate, then return the value

the full-time function will accept exp, for years worked.  They have an annual pay of 25k
if they worked from 2 - 4 years, they get 1.5x raise and a bonus of 500
if they worked from 4 - 10 years, they get a 2x raise and a bonus of 1000
if they worked over 10 years, they get a 3x raise and a bonus of 1500
anything else, they do not get a raise and their bonus is 200

In the main program, make a loop to start and end the program
everytime it runs, it'll ask for a name and type (salary or hourly)
if type = hourly, ask for the number of hours worked and use the hourly function in a variable
if type = salary, ask for years worked and use the salary function in a variableAnything else, print "You are unemployeed!"
Once the loop breaks, print the employee name and their payrate
